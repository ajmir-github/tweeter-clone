- **Right Sidebar**: Trending hashtags and “Who to follow” suggestions.

### 👤 Profile Page

- **Header**: Cover photo, avatar, name, @username, bio, follow/unfollow button.
- **Stats**: Followers, following, tweet count.
- **Tabs**: Tweets, Replies, Media, Likes.
- **Main Content**: User’s tweets displayed in card format.

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Three-column layout** (desktop):
  - Left: Sidebar navigation
  - Center: Main feed
  - Right: Discovery (trending + suggestions)
- **Mobile-first responsiveness**: Collapses to single column with bottom nav bar.
- **Minimalist style**: Clean white background, light gray dividers, accent blue highlights.
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Roboto).
- **Consistency**: Same card structure across feeds for familiarity.

## 📌 Notes

- Wireframes are grayscale for clarity and focus on structure.
- Media-first tweet layout: images/videos appear before text and hashtags.
- Extensible design: easy to add retweets, quote tweets, or dark mode later.
